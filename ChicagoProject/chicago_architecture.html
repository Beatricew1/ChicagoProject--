	<p id="ar"> Maybe I’m biased because I live here, but Chicago’s architecture is some of the best in the States. I don’t have much to say but let the work speak for itself. The lines, texture, colors, height, depth, shape, etc. It’s a sight to see seeing this downtown and being able to walk and go up into the buildings.

		<p id="pc"> I took these photos by the river walk. I went kayaking that day with some friends, and it was food! I recommend doing this activity in the summer of Chicago.
