	<h1> Greetings!</h1>
	<p> Hello! I'm Beatrice! Thank you for taking the time to go through my website. I really enjoy living in Chicago, and I'm happy that I was able to share my love for it with you. Here's a little about me!
</p>
	
	
	<h2> My Hobbies </h2>
	<p> I enjoy doing a variety of things and learning something new. You know those people who like to try something out and add something else to their list? That's me. Some of my hobbies include:
	</p>
  <nav class="hobbies" >
      <ul class="hobbies">
	      <li class="hobbies">Painting </li>
          <li class="hobbies">Dancing </li>
          <li class="hobbies"> Reading </li>
          <li class="hobbies"> Working Out </li>
          <li class="hobbies"> Watching Kdramas </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>	
	
	<p> I'm very into the arts and love watching others preform. Whether it's an art tutorial or watching people dance at concerts, I enjoy having a nice time. 
	It's especially fun having my friends and family with me to enjoy activites. My friends and family mean a lot to me, and I love helping them out in anyway that I can. 
	Helping others brings more meaning to my life.
	</p>


	<p> Have a safe and great weekend!
	</p>
